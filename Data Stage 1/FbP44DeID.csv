Multiple sclerosis is a autoimmune disease which cause the immune cells to target the myelin sheaths around the axons which then disrupts saltatory conduction. This causes the signal to decay as it spends more time travelling along the axon due to resistance. Cooling reduces decay by prolonging action potentials in the nerve and therefore increases the odds of it reaching other neurons without decaying completely.

Multiple sclerosis is a autoimmune disease which cause the immune cells to target the myelin sheaths around the axons which then disrupts saltatory conduction. This causes the signal to decay as it spends more time travelling along the axon due to resistance. Cooling reduces decay by prolonging action potentials in the nerve and therefore increases the odds of it reaching other neurons without decaying completely. However. cooling will decrease the response times of these nerves (latency). ",NA,"Yes"

Multiple sclerosis is a autoimmune disease which cause the immune cells to target the myelin sheaths around the axons which then disrupts saltatory conduction. This causes the signal to decay as it spends more time travelling along the axon due to resistance. Cooling reduces decay by prolonging action potentials in the nerve and therefore increases the odds of it reaching other neurons without decaying completely. However. cooling will decrease the response times of these nerves (latency). ",NA,"Yes"

Multiple sclerosis is a autoimmune disease which cause the immune cells to target the myelin sheaths around the axons which then disrupts saltatory conduction.

Multiple sclerosis is a autoimmune disease which cause the immune cells to target the myelin sheaths around the axons which then disrupts saltatory conduction. This causes the signal to decay as it spends more time travelling along the axon due to resistance. Cooling reduces decay by prolonging action potentials in the nerve and therefore increases the odds of it reaching other neurons without decaying completely.

Multiple sclerosis is a autoimmune disease which cause the immune cells to target the myelin sheaths around the axons which then disrupts saltatory conduction. This causes the signal to decay as it spends more time travelling along the axon due to resistance. Cooling reduces decay by prolonging action potentials in the nerve and therefore increases the odds of it reaching other neurons without decaying completely. However. cooling will decrease the response times of these nerves (latency). ",NA,"Yes"

Multiple sclerosis is a autoimmune disease which cause the immune cells to target the myelin sheaths around the axons which then disrupts saltatory conduction. This causes the signal to decay as it spends more time travelling along the axon due to resistance. Cooling reduces decay by prolonging action potentials in the nerve and therefore increases the odds of it reaching other neurons without decaying completely.

Multiple sclerosis is a autoimmune disease which cause the immune cells to target the myelin sheaths around the axons which then disrupts saltatory conduction. This causes the signal to decay as it spends more time travelling along the axon due to resistance. Cooling reduces decay by prolonging action potentials in the nerve and therefore increases the odds of it reaching other neurons without decaying completely.

Multiple sclerosis is a autoimmune disease which cause the immune cells to target the myelin sheaths around the axons which then disrupts saltatory conduction. This causes the signal to decay as it spends more time travelling along the axon due to resistance. Cooling reduces decay by prolonging action potentials in the nerve and therefore increases the odds of it reaching other neurons without decaying completely.
