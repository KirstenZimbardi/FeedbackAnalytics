## Playing with SVM to predict academic performance

load data
```{r}
#packages
require(reshape2)
require(dplyr)
require(e1071)
require(neuralnet)

#functions
source("UQM functions.R")
source("HelperFunctions.R")

path = "/Users/KirstenZ/Dropbox/UQ/FeedbackAnalytics/Usage paper/Analysis"
ProjectID = read.csv(paste0(path, "/Data Stage 1/ProjectIDs.csv"))
projects()
#graphs()


#data
folder = paste0(path, "/Data Stage 2/")
demog = uqm.csv("demog")
AcP = uqm.csv("AcPdf")
#FbPsum = uqm.csv("FbPsummary")
#FbP = uqm.csv("FbPdf")
#FbU = uqm.csv("FbUdf")
#AcPFbUbins = uqm.csv("AcPFbUbins")
#SubID.index = uqm.csv("SubIDindex")
#mt = uqm.csv("MarkingTimes")

#Generalising
demog = gen(demog, 13, 14)
AcP = gen(AcP, 7, 8)
FbP = gen(FbP, 15, 16)
FbU = gen(FbU, 22, 23)
AcPFbUbins = gen(AcPFbUbins, 7, 8)
SubID.index = gen(SubID.index, 4, 5)
mt = gen(mt, 7, 8)
#FbPsum does not inlude project details, need to merge in from AcP
#FbP.sum = merge(FbPsum, AcP, by="SubmissionID", all.y=T)
#FbP.sum[which(is.na(FbP.sum[,2])),] #bunch of Submissions for which there are marks but no meta-data on Fb provision - possible error in generating FbPsummary?
#ignoring this for now and just generating Fig 2-4 based on data that is in FbPsummary.csv
FbP.AcP = merge(FbPsum, AcP, by="SubmissionID")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
