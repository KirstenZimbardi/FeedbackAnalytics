You are just stretching the muscle. Contraction of the muscle only happens in this case is when you send a stimulus towards the sciatic nerve. The reason why you see an increase in contraction strength initially is because you are providing more space for the myosin and actin to move (to contract) and as you increase the passive tension. you would reach a point where you see a drop in contraction strength because myosin and actin are no longer in contact with each other in some sarcomeres.
